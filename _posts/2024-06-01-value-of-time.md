title: Value of Time
---

Most folks have ambitious dreams and grandiose goals. Who does not want to achieve extraordinary achievements and leave a legacy behind? To prove their worth and demonstrate that they left an impact on this world.

But what many fail to realize is that in order to achieve outsized outcomes requires an unwavering commitment. You and everyone else in this world runs on the same 24 hours in a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days in a year schedule. You cannot bend or slow time; it runs the same for everyone. You can only fit so much within that time.

I recently read somewhere that Brian Chesky, one of the founders of AirBnb, talked about how they used to start their day at 8 in the morning and work till midnight non-stop. They did this continuously every single day, for more than six months. Every single day, no breaks, no weekends, nothing. Their life was their startup.

And I am by no means recommending that you need to burn your life. However, what I can definitely say for sure is that rewarding outcomes require you to put everything that you have into your pursuits. If you don't do whatever it takes, someone out there will beat you to it. So, ask yourself: how badly do you want to achieve your goals, and what are you willing to sacrifice to make them a reality?
