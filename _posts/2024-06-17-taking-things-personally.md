title: Taking Things Personally
---

One thing I have always noticed about myself is that whenever someone points out a shortcoming in my work or personal life, my defensive side immediately kicks in and tries to repel the perceived attack.

Even when the feedback is a genuine suggestion, useful advice, or something I genuinely need to address, my inner conscience often takes it offensively, as if I have failed to live up to some ideal standard.

I have tried to analyze this behavior multiple times, and I believe it stems from my obsession with perfection. Many of us strive to be the best versions of ourselves, and when our flaws are pointed out, no matter how minor, it feels like an attack on our character, ethics, and results. This leads to feelings of judgment and belittlement, which can often undermine our confidence.

Humans are not meant to be perfect. We make mistakes and learn from them. Adapting to our environment and moving forward requires a tremendous amount of self-control and commitment.

Recently, I started handling this defensive reaction differently. Instead of responding immediately, I now take a moment to analyze the situation from another perspective before making a decision.

I cannot overstate how effective this has been for me. I have come to realize that I was often taking minor comments personally, which distorted my perception of reality. By pausing and reconsidering, I can respond more thoughtfully and constructively.

Stop taking things personally. At the end of the day, no one really cares. What matters is what you gain from each experience. If you learn a lesson, you have grown as a person. If you develop a grudge, you have probably taken two steps backward. The choice is yours to make.
