title: Consistency is what counts
---

Most often, people look for extraordinary traits in successful individuals to figure out how they achieved their success. My fundamental belief is that it all boils down to consistency.

As they say, Rome was not built in a day. If you want to make significant changes in your life or achieve tremendous outcomes, you probably won't do that within a day, a week, or even a month. What is required is consistent, conscious effort, every single day without fail.

There will be times when you want to give up, and you almost cave in to not putting in that millimetric effort that eventually counts towards your progress. Believe me, this will happen quite often initially. Overcoming that urge will be among the hardest things you might do in life. It's always easy to give in.

And then there will be times when, despite your best efforts, the consistency breaks, and you feel guilty. That is a good thing. It means that you have made it a part of your routine and were progressing towards something. Make sure you feel the guilt because that's the only way you'll jump right back where you left off and ensure it doesn't happen again.

After I came back from my vacation, I made it a point to attend a fixed number of Cult classes every week, no matter whether it's raining, there are office meetings, or I have to meet someone. I would not accept any excuses.

This week was particularly challenging, with lots of reschedules and evening slots filling up, which meant taking classes at odd times, like 7 a.m. or 4 p.m. But I made sure not to skip. In my opinion, that not skipping part is what counts.

So go ahead, set just one goal for the coming week. Don't make it too ambitious—something small and achievable—and ensure you stick to it no matter what happens. Do this every week, and you'll see the magical compounding effect kick in.
